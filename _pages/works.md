# Algorithmic Works

Sound works created mostly with MusaDSL and rendered with Max/MSP, Supercollider, Ableton Live and Bitwig Studio.

## An Elevator Door's 16 Selected Seconds (2018, remixed for stereo on 2023)

New remixed stereo version of the original 12 channels 'An Elevator Door's 16 Selected Seconds' that was premiered
as a shortened version (An Elevator Door's 6 Selected Seconds) in Hangar, Barcelona, in 2018.

Open the door. Open the inner doors. Close the door. Close the inner doors. Press the button. Going up. Reverse repeat.
16 seconds of sound events traveled, millisecond to millisecond, through microscopic samples with durations between 0.1ms and 84ms.
The evolving loop keeps the sound in the frontier between the rhythmic pulses, the continous tone and a draft of perceptual event.
Harmonies generated through the reproduction of microloops with sample-rates of harmonic multiples.
Exploration of the timbre-harmony binomial.

Created with MusaDSL, Max/MSP, Ableton Live and remixed in Bitwig Studio.

Listen with headphones!
